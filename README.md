## Welcome ! 🐧

My name is Gabriel Dupuis, I am an engineering student at ENSTA Paris. I am specialized in Computer Science and AI.
I am currently working on:
- 🧠 A Neural Network Framework built from scratch in C++
- 📘 A LLM classifying text according to the emotion embedded in it
- 👓 Clairvoyance: Smart Glasses with a vocal assistant to help visually impaired individual in their home

I have already worked on:
- 🔢 A MNIST digit classifier
- 🔵 Reinforcement Learning to optimize water irrigation surface
- 🧍 A crowd physics simulation to study crowd dynamics and avoid stampedes
- ↪️ A maze generator and solver


If you don't see one of these projects on my GitHub, it's because I'm still working on it, but it will be available very soon.

Feel free to contact me via my email or LinkedIn !
